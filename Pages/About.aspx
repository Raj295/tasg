    <h3>Jaguar F-Type</h3>
    <p> 
The F-Type shows that Jaguar can produce a car of true sporting specialism . It’s a machine of incredible, multi-faceted allure – and, like the E-Type was, it’s great value.
The car falls short of being truly exceptional – it has too many imperfections and shortcomings for that. On usability, it comes up short next to plenty of sports cars, having only two seats, offering slightly cramped accommodation even for two, and limited boot space in convertible forms. And yet, in multi-cylinder engine guises particularly, it has performance and handling dynamism every bit as boisterous as its throaty, vivacious soul – and a driving experience to savour.
There can be no question that the F-Type is another landmark in the 21st-century recasting of the Jaguar brand. While not perfect, it is an inspired, wonderful car.

    <h3>Porsche 911 Carrera</h3>
    <p> 
So far we’ve driven the new 992 generation of Porsche’s 911 in both rear-driven Carrera S and four-wheel-drive Carrera 4S guises, the former only on track, and yet both early tests suggested that this eighth-generation, rear-engined sporting hero is every inch as great a driver’s car as the 991 it’s replacing this year – and, if anything, stands ready to take the game away from its rivals.
Having grown longer and slightly wider than the car it replaces, the 992 is so far only available in 444bhp 3.0-litre turbo ‘S’-derivative form, with an eight-speed PDK gearbox and with either rear- or four-wheel drive. Both versions use what used to be called the 911’s ‘widebody’ shell (which has been lightened by more extensive use of aluminium in its construction), while four-wheel steering is now an option even on non-GT-level cars and mixed-width wheels and tyres come as standard.

    <h3> BMW i8</h3>
    <p>

The i8 is one of the most compelling and unusual sports cars we’ve tested in years, not only because of its fascinating plug-in hybrid powertrain, its appealing driving experience and its otherworldly design, but also because of how exquisitely finished it feels as a product – both inside and outside – and how easy it would be to live with.
That the car’s handling dynamics fall slightly short of the very best we’d expect of a sports car is a minor drawback for the i8 – but the problem only really takes the edge off the car’s appeal when it comes to track driving.
The i8 will pinch sales from the 911, no doubt. And while the Porsche remains far better to drive, you can easily see why you might fancy driving what feels like the sports car of the future instead.
